The three scripts below will generate the box plots reported in the paper, illustrating the distribution of relevance score for the retrived documents by four different retrieval pipelines, 
including ConvDR, and BM25 with three different query rewriter i.e., QuReTeC, T5 and Human. 

```
python plot_box_cast-19.py # generates CAsT-19.png
python plot_box_cast-20.py # generates CAsT-20.png 
python plot_box_or-quac.py # generates QuAC.png
